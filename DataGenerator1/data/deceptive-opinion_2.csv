truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"Very friendly staff - and helpfull with whatever ? you may have. Don't miss the wine bar and the hot chocolate bar. Spacious rooms. Perfect for business and for theatre guests. A little quiet area during weekends. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip. The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great. I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny, but ours was perfectly fine, with funky, fun doors. The decor is a lot of fun. We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise. The front desk staff was very friendly, and before we even made it to the desk, a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival. We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier. For people who were upset about no free coffee - there's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away. I definitely recommend this hotel! 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"We brought our giant rottweiler and she had a great time. Small rooms, but this is normal for the chicago hotel scene. Lots of interesting amenities in the room. Convenient to theatres and downtown restaurants and shopping. Really loved the lobby -- a great place to hang around or wait for someone. Lots of nooks and crannies and little tables and sofas everywhere. Watch out: The concierge (like all concierges at big hotels) will direct you to mediocre, large restaurants where they get kickbacks. We have stayed here several times and I always check for rooms here when I travel to Chicago. However, the hotel is often full so book early. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"The only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other Kimpton hotels. It was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee. The robes were not in the room and it took a long time (hours) but other than that a great place. The concierge was excellent. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I stayed at the Allegro for several days in August 2004 and I would defintely stay again. I had a very large room with a huge bathroom, although the property is a converted theater so the rooms may vary in size and layout. The lobby is comfortable with big sofas and chaise lounges, a nice place to enjoy the simple (2 choices, no munchies) but pleasant wine reception. At night, there is not much going on in the immediate vicinity, other than theater traffic, but it's a short cab ride to Michigan Avenue shopping and River North restaurants. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"This is best hotel bargin in Chicago if you are not overly unhappy with a small room. Great hotel just redone by Kimpton. This is a great hotel chain that really provides a the sense of escape and fun to all of their hotels. This is a location just off of LaSalle and next to the Cadillac theater. It has a 4 star resturant which we enjoyed in a relaxed atmosphere an amazing Italian meal. The wine list is one of the best in a city of great restaurants. The Kimptons have a social hour 5 to 6 with wine at all of their hotels. You sit in a designer, kind of London circa 1968 couch with a fire place nearby and have that lost art form of relaxation with you fellow guests. They are super animal friendly and provide complete services to your dog if you wish to bring it. The exercise room is great and there is a spa here as well. There are two other Kimptons here but for the money the Allegro is the best value and location. Always consider Kimptons as they never disappoint where ever we have used them. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"Booked via Priceline.com for a weekend getaway and got the room for $75 per night. When we arrived via Midway we took the Orange Line to within a block of the hotel for just $2. Hotel easy to find. Never felt uncomfortable with the neighborhood/area. Saw very few homeless or panhandlers. Walked all over the place. Great location and hotel is about a $5-$6 cab ride from most major attractions/shopping/restaurants. Hotel is almost gawdy with colors/decor, but it's not that different from a cruise ship decor. It was not annoying decor by any means. Check in was painless and the service was great! Heard NO noise whatsoever...the reports of 'thin walls' are greatly exaggerated. The walls are all concrete and thick...we heard NOTHING both nights we were there! Highly recommend this hotel! Rooms are small but not crowded for two people...they are old style hotel rooms..very classic 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"We stayed in a king suite at the Hotel Allegro over Memorial Day weekend. We paid $130/night, and it was definitely a bargain. The suite was huge - living room with a couch, two chairs, desk; large bathroom; bedroom; two closets. The room had recently been renovated, and was very clean. Comfortable bed, friendly staff, great location (near the train and bus), evening wine reception and morning coffee provided. While the Allegro isn't a five-star hotel, it is a great place for the money. (Note: a friend stayed in a non-suite room, and reported that it was very small. Upgrade if possible). 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March, 2006. We had a great time! We were upgraded to a suite, and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with Mr. Bubbles, animal print robes, and a luxurious king- sized bed! THe suite was very nice, and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street. It was very boutiquey, and the lobby was lovely. We enjoyed the complementary wine hour. The staff was attentive, and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to Chicago memorable! We would return here! 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I had a great time here! It is centerally located in Chicago so walking around is so easy and pleasent. The staff was amazing and very helpful! Parking was a bit steep, but to be expected. The room was very nice and the bed and linens were very confortable. The yoga mat rental was wonderful as well! Wonderful and relaxing experience overall. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"The Allegro in downtown Chicago is a great stay/ part of the Kimpton Group boutique hotels the Allegro offers a classy stay in a beautiful room for a moterate price/ they offer complimentary and decent wine gratis in the late afternoon and the hotel allows you access to everything the loop has to offer in this remarkable city. i would recommend parking outside of the downtown area and taking the 'EL' into the loop which leaves you about 2 minutes from the hotel/ otherwise you are looking at hefty parking fees for a car you dont need in this part of the city . the rooms are small but beautifully done with great colors,comfortable beds and in my case great views. if you go to kimpton group website and sign up for specials you will be alerted to great rates on certain days / kimpton does a great job and their properties are 'class acts' 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"If you're in Chicago and want to stay in The Loop, The Allegro Hotel is perfect for you. It's centrally located, stylish rooms and attentive staff. I stayed at the hotel for 3 nights and was very pleased with everything. The bed was very comfy and had plenty of fluffy pillows, large flat screen tv, radio with ipod docking station and bathroom was hip and clean. Everyone that I came in contact with was very friendly and helpful. My last day there, I ordered room service and not only was my meal perfect and delivered on time, the kitchen called to see if everything was alright. I have never had that kind of follow up service. I've stayed at the Palomar in DC, another Kimpton hotel and received exceptional service there too. I will definitely see if Kimpton has a hotel at my next destination. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I am a fan of Kimpton Hotels, however I have never experienced top service as I did at the Hotel Allegro. Even before my visit, concierge Mark Kraemer advised us on things to see, and booked tickets in advance to Second City. We were welcomed warmly on arrival, and the bellman checked up on us as we came and went from the hotel. All the staff have a personal interest in making your stay a great experience. The hotel is next to City Hall, where I had some business. We had a large quiet room, and used room service-the meal came quickly, and included a a bonus fruit cup. Enjoyed the pasta night (20 dollars for a three course meal) at the 312 restaurant-the starter and the dessert were wonderful, the main pasta a bit too salty. And that is the only complaint I can make-from start to finish, if you want attentive service, this is the place to be. Thank you, Hotel Allegro, for a great stay. I can't wait to return. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago, an older hotel with a great reno (a bit over-the-top design, but still very lovely and charming), clean rooms, and very friendly staff. They're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag (treats and directions to an off-leash area), and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog's names on it. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I stayed here for 2 nights in May 2008. I have to say the hotel was exceptionally clean and very modern and funky. They had a free wine tasting each evening! The restaurant served very good breakfasts and the staff were lovely and helpful throughout the stay. The hotel is located within walking distance to the metro system and also close to shopping / restaurants and sights! Rooms were lovely, althou the bathroom was slightly on the compact side. Will be back. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro. However, our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful. The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another. The bathroom was small but well appointed. Overall, it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased. Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway. One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I can't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe. The area is also very close to public transportation (we used the trains exclusively) and got around quite well without a car. We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"A very nice hotel with small but adequate rooms. The decor was lovely. My daughter and I spent 5-nights here, saw Wicked just down the street and used the public transportation to get all around town. Was a bit disappointed with the bar/restaurant which opened and closed it's kitchen at will without regard to posted hours. The room description boasted of safe's large enough to accomodate a laptop, so I brought mine. I was informed after check-in that the safes are not in every room (and not in mine). As a side note, I was surprised that nearly all the shops many restaurants closed at 6pm in that area... even the 7-11. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"We have stayed here several times and have always found it to be clean with comfortable beds. We were given a choice of breakfast or free cocktails which we thought was a nice touch. Our room was small but adequate. Location was great, close to the L trains and also close to the train station as we always 'walk' from Union Station. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"I've stayed at the Allegro a couple of times. Like the other Kimpton properties, it's a classic old hotel that's been beautifully updated. I found the staff to be cordial, and I really like their corporate culture. They're pet-friendly (although I wasn't travelling with the dog), I got a recycling bin in my room, Aveda products in the bath and they don't clean with toxic chemicals. The rooms aren't huge and the bathrooms aren't what you're going to get at a Hilton. What the Allegro lacks in square footage it more than makes up for in cool. OK, they may be a little pricey, but I'm willing to pay a bit more considering the higher cost of doing business responsibily. 
"
truthful,allegro,positive,TripAdvisor,"We booked this hotel for the second leg of our Chicago stay..it was great!!!! The Lion King package was pricey but reasonable, given the ticket costs and the Suite. Room was great....classical music greeted us when we entered our room after a long day of sightseeing and shopping. NYTimes and Chicago Tribune at your door every morning. One block from the Washington El train station. We never saw the small rooms that every one apparently doesn't like, but the Suite rooms were fun and our kids loved it. Dunkin Doughnuts and Corner Bakery down the block. City Hall, Picasso structure....this was a great place. Book it and also use the Golden Touch Limo service...reasonable. Omar is a super guy. 
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"When I had to visit Chicago for business I asked some of my associates where to stay and several of them recommended the Hotel Allegro. After my stay I can honestly say that I agree. From the luxurious bedding to the technological amenities, everything was thought of. The only place I find more comfortable then this hotel is my actual home. I now know where I will be staying every time I have business in this city, and anyone I know who is doing the same will hear so.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"The Hotel Allegro in Chicago is understated luxury. I love the minimalist decor, and the linens were quality and exquisite. You can't beat the location, either, it's located in the heart of the theatre district. Walking distance to all the great restaurants in Chicago! They also offer an in-room spa service, which is pure decadence. I chose to indulge in the Eucalyptus Mani/pedi. It was by far the priciest manicure and pedicure I have had in my life (135 dollars) but it was a wonderful experience. The eucalyptus treatments left my hands and feet feeling so soft yet refreshed at the same time. I highly recommend this hotel if you want to experience the finer thingsthis gorgeous city has to offer.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My wife and I stayed at the allegro this weekend while I was on a business trip. I was very impressed with their hospitality and my wife very much(maybe too much) enjoyed the in-house spa. Rooms service was a bit slow but, overall great hotel would stay again. 
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"During a recent business trip to Chicago I had the pleasure of staying at the Hotel Allegro. The lobby gave a good first impression. It was a very clean with a modern designer's feel and the customer service was great. I proceeded to the counter to check-in and within 5 minutes I had the key to my room. I was told to check out the infamous 312 restaurant but I was tired from my flight. I checked into my room. The room was great. A king size bed 37' flat screen tv and standard desk all designer furniture. After I unpacked I had to check my email. Hooking up to their Wi-Fi was quick and painless! I had a good night sleep and early wake up the next day for my business meeting. I decided to try the restaurant for breakfast. I had an omelet and fruit. The restaurant was great and the food was perfect. I only wish I had more time to stay and enjoy lunch; nevertheless duty called. The concierge had my taxi waiting for me right after breakfast and I was off to work. I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago. It's one of the best I've ever stayed at after multiple business trips.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"I went here with the family, including our dog Marley(They are very pet friendly). We really enjoyed it. This place is huge with over 480 rooms and suites and is in the center of downtown close to shopping and entertainment. It also seems that it would be a great place to have a wedding or to host an event. I will definately be coming back next time I need to come to chicago definately a fine four star hotel!
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"Having come to Chicago with my three sisters for a relaxing weekend of shopping and spa days, the Hotel Allegro Chicago filled every bit of my checklist. We arrived and immediately were checked in and shown to our rooms; we both had the 'double double deluxe'. The rooms were gorgeous, well taken care of, clean, comfortable, well decorated and luxurious. The hotel also has a spa which was perfect because we didn't even have to leave the hotel for our relaxing spa day. The hotel has great staff, they were always attentive to our needs. My favorite part was the complimentary tea and cofee - I am a coffee addict and getting my caffeine fix any time of every day was great! Stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago if you want great service from a relaxing and luxurious hotel in the heart of Chicago's hustle and bustle!
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"For Top Class Treatment Choose Hotel Allegro. In all of my years of buisness travel and vacationing, I have never been more happy with the service at a hotel than I was at Hotel Allegro. I searched many hotel websites looking for the perfect hotel to spend our honeymoon, and Hotel Allegro seemed like the right choice. Soon as I walked into to their elaborate lobby area, it was like I was a big shot on Wallstreet, the service was excellent and the best part, they allow animals. They treated my little dog Johnny like he was royalty. They have everything you could ever need in a hotel, from in room spa service to a workout center. They even made sure that I had all of my drinks and amentites ready for the Monday night Bears game. If I were to give have to rate it from a 1 - 10. Id have to give it a 10 many times over. I highly recommend Hotel Allegro in Chicago Illinois and I will be back again.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"This was my first time in Chicago and I tell you they really made me feel like a million bucks. I took a taxi straight from the airport and was greeted at the door by a kind gentlemen who offered to help me with my luggage and assisted me to the check-in counter. I made my way up to my room, which was spectacularly bright and well-lit, then I ordered some food. All in all the food was delicious and the staff were fantastic. If I didn't have such a short stay in Chicago I would have stayed in my hotel room all day!
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My wife and I stayed here for a weekend and we absolutely loved it. The atmosphere was very chic & upscale; in my opinion you get more than what you pay for with the brand name amenities without breaking the bank. My wife even got to bring along her dog (aka #1 man!). I would definitely stay here again & would recommend it to anyone staying in the Chicago area.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"A few nights ago, I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in the Theater District of Chicago. I'd heard some amazing things about the great food, and how friendly the staff were. Upon arrival, the service at the front desk and the bellman was fantastic! They treated me as if I stayed there all the time! The rooms were cozy, with very comfortable beds that helped me sleep through my jet lag. I ordered breakfast the next morning, and had room service bring it up. The meal was brought up only a few minutes after ordering, and was delicious! I would recommend these accommodations for anyone traveling, or any families staying in Chicago, as the rooms were very reasonably priced, and is a short distance to lots of great sites. Next time I come through Chicago, I will definitely be staying here! 
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to celebrate our 2nd wedding anniversary this past weekend. The hotel is the perfect combination of sophistication and glamour from the moment you arrive. The concierge staff was very friendly and accommodating throughout our weekend stay, and the hotel itself provided many interesting and fun things to do. We were very impressed with the overall setup of the hotel; the lobby, dining areas, and rooms all had a special touch of class that made our weekend exciting and full of luxury. The decor of our room was very modern and eclectic with hues of blue and white, and lighting that complimented and set the mood. The bar and lounge areas had excellent service, and the views from our room perfectly captured the excitement of downtown Chicago. Additionally, my husband and I were extra pleased to learn that because we are AAA members, we would be receiving 20% off our room rate for the weekend. Overall, the amenities and experience of staying at the Hotel Allegro Chicago made us feel like movie stars, pampered and taken care of all weekend in a classy establishment, one in which we would definitely choose to stay again.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"Hotel Allegro Chicago is a beautiful place. I was originally dreading being in Chicago due to the fact it was all business and no play, but as soon as I saw the inside of the hotel I was stunned! I wasn't expecting to stay at a place that made business trip feel like a get-away vacation. The service there was amazing, everybody was very friendly. When I saw my room, once again my jaw almost dropped. The room was fit for a king, the designs on the wall were so elegant. The beds were extraordinarily comfy. I think for my next business trip I am going to bring my wife and kids with me. I give this Kimpton Hotel 5/5 stars!
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk," If you are traveling to Chicago and need a place to stay, I highly recommend the Hotel Allegro Chicago. It was visiting time visiting Chicago for the first time on a business trip and a friend referred me to the Hotel Allegro. He said they were pet friendly,which was a huge plus. This is because I hate leaving my kitten muffin with a pet sitter every time I travel for business. Upon my arrival, I was met with friendly valet who treated me like I was the only customer who mattered. I walked in and saw a hotel like no other I have seen before or after. The lobby was decorated with modern furniture and paintings and looked like a place I could relax in. After I had entered and checked in, I saw the staircase, which looked like a testament to the staircase in the 'Titanic'. Frankly, I was amazed and I had not even entered my room yet. My room was a Queen Deluxe room and it was amazing. The bed had a blue headboard,which I have never seen before, and the colors worked together so well I seriously contemplated living there. The room service was exceptional and promptly brought the food I ordered. Later I wanted to get a drink and I enjoyed it at The Bar 312, which is conveniently located adjacent to the hotel. These are the specifics of my stay, but there is much more to be experienced that I did not mention if you visit the Hotel Allegro. In summary, they allow pets, the service is amazing, the decoration superb, and it is conveniently situated next to dining establishments. What more could a person ask for?
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My fiancee and I were looking for a modern, upscale venue for our wedding reception. We have found the perfect location at The James. From the ballroom to the personal attention to detail, each step was handled with care. Now that we have locked in our date, we are more excited than ever. Thank you staff at The James for making our day even more special!
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My friends and I were in Chicago last month and were looking for a resonably priced hotel in a decent neighborhood. Well we came across the Hotel Allegro and immediately fell in love! Everything from the colors, the staff, the architecture, and the pricing were AMAZING! We couldn't have found a better hotel. The service was impeccable..talk about a 5 star hotel for someone with a 2 star budget! My friends and I plan on staying here next year when we return.. I can't wait until then! 
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer. During this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro. I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations, the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous, and the whole process was quick, easy, and painless. Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon, the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease. The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent. Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up. 
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"I have to admit, I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia, but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago, my fears were slightly assuaged. A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before, and had nothing but positive things to say. With this new-found optimism in mind, I went forward on my journey in confidence. I have to say, I was not let down. From the moment I stepped into the lobby, I felt at home. The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms, and the check-in process was fast and efficient. The rooms themselves are incredibly homey, feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire's mansion. The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels, really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago, and provided a secure place to stay at night, or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group. Of course, the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel. I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building. Overall it's very cozy, and has a certain old-world feeling to it, once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times. It was never overwhelmingly crowded, and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly, yet not intrusive. I don't usually enjoy staying in hotels, but I love the Allegro Chicago!
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"I recently had the pleasure of spending three nights at the Hotel Allegro Chicago to attend a corporate meeting. To say the rooms at this beautifully renovated hotel are stylish is an understatement. I stayed in one of the more moderately priced rooms yet found all the amenities of premium rooms at other hotels. My room was spacious and furnished in a retro-modern style. A fully stocked refreshment center, wet bar, and LCD HD TV were amongst the standard items. The Allegro is in the center of everything, the Chicago Loop of the financial district, the Chicago Theatre district, great shopping on Slate Street and fine dinning is available adjacent to the hotel (I suggest the 312 Lunch Club). The fitness room is well equipped and clean. The professional and friendly service was the icing on the cake during my stay at the Allegro. My next visit to the Chicago area will definitely include a stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago. 
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"Extravagant, Exuberant Experience! Our stay at Hotel Allegro was very enjoyable. The intoxicating views made the get-away much more relaxing, as well as the exceptional room service. The rooms were very decorative and well above par. I very much enjoyed the complimentary tea. I Would highly recommend Hotel Allegro as a must stay vacation get-away.
"
deceptive,allegro,positive,MTurk,"My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience! The staff were helpful and considerate, always there to tend to my needs. My suite was extremely clean, and had all the amenities that I could ask for. I almost didn't want to leave my room, because it was so nice. But in the end I did, because the hotel is situated in such a great area, that I had to go out and see some of the sites. This hotel has wonderful rooms and service, and is in a really great area. I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"As a frequent traveler to Chicago, I generally stay at the Sutton Court, but thought I would try a different boutique hotel. I will never stay at this hotel again. The first room they brought me to -- their standard room -- was a glorified closet, leaving me absolutely claustrophobic! Actually the smallest hotel room I've been in in the U.S! I complained to the front desk, who then moved me to a 'premium' room -- still quite small, but manageably so. The bathroom was tiny, without a vanity, making it difficult to put your toiletries in the room. The location leaves much to be desired, as my room looked out directly onto the El (elevated subway - background noise), and the street was pretty deserted on a Sunday evening. I will say that the free wi-fi was great. If you can find a chain or other hotel closer to Michigan Avene, I'd highly recommend you take that. If you want a nice room in a great location, check out Sutton Place hotel instead.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"This hotel is rather stupid to be frank. It's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional. The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there isn't much in them. I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink. I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days. It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything. I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors aren't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night. On a good note, the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean. That's about the only good thing I can say about this place. I would not go back.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"where do I start. The GM was a nice guy for handling the incident I had. Anthony -the Concierge - set me up with a massage when the reservation at the spa i requested was unavailable. Anthony said he knew this spa and it was nice. He set me up and quoted me a price of $125, When i got to the spa (which was actually a seedy nail and hair salon) i saw on the front window that a massage for an hour was $100 with 20% off. At the end of the massage I gave the lady $100 and said thanks you can keep the change, She insisted that I got 'A Hotel Rate' because Anthony set me up. She called Anthony and confirmed the rate then told me she had to go and pay Anthony the difference - $45. She then offered me a ride to the hotel since she was going there which I declined. In short - shady dealings with this place. I was quite taken back. The GM Selman comp'd me a night but , I felt swindled big time. Stay somewhere else. The concierge has something going on...
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"Me and my husband stayed in the Allegro Hotel Chicago for 4 days 3 nights recently. We got a room with a king size bed.. Although the room is small, we got no problems with that as there was enough space for our luggages & all. However, we felt that the bed is not exactly comfortable, the bed sheets kinda feel rough to us. The walls are really thin and we could hear our neighbours talking and occasionally the flushing sound. 1 of the days, our room was not cleaned till afternoon and so we went to check with the front desk and was told that we got to request for our room to be cleaned which was a shock to us as we thought that like all hotels, rooms are cleaned except when you put on the no disturb sign. The worst is upon returning to the hotel at night, we found a bag of our garbage in the room and it was right next to our luggage. The housekeeping people must have forgotten to take it out after cleaning our bins. This is unacceptable to us. The hotel is in the theatre district and it is rather quiet at night. Although it is near the CTA trains, i would rec one to stay somewhere close to the magnificent mile where its lively at night or hotels near the chicago river so that you can get a great view. Am staying again at a Kimpton hotel in San Fran next month and i am contemplating if i should change! Overall, not a good experience and i wouldnt choose this hotel again if i were to head to Chicago again!
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"This hotel must have originally been an ordinary downtown hotel in a not very nice neighborhood. The owners have painted it over and fixed up the lobby to make it an 'upscale' overpriced boutique hotel. But it's still just an ordinary hotel with a paint job. Stay here if you want to experience staying in a flophouse, but with all the sleaze removed. Definitely stay at the chain's other location, the Burnham, for a much, much nicer hotel.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"I stayed at the Allegro Hotel while interviewing for a position in Chicago. I read the reviews and they were mixed, but since the property was suggested by the organization (due to location), I booked a room. True to the reviews, the room was extremely small, was cold (the heater blew in cold air in -2 degree weather), and just generally uncomfortable. There was no closet so I hung my suit on the doorknob of the door of the adjoining room. The bathroom was extremely small and although tidy, not especially clean (it was dusty). The bed (which was supposed to be a queen but was really a full) was quite low and the sheets were hard. Because I arrived late, I ordered room service. There was so little space in the room that the wait staff had to approach the desk/table sideways. Although there is free wireless (a plus), I kept getting kicked out of the system and had to, no lie, reconnect on-line a record 16 times. Finally, to top it all off, the television stopped working just a little before midnight. I was only there for one evening (not even 12 hours) but that was enough for me. This is supposed to be a 4 star boutique hotel but I've stayed at better 2 star properties. On the positive side, the staff is nice and friendly, the food is reasonably good, and the lobby is really vibrant. There is a martini bar (although as I was coming in, a hotel guest was complaining about it being unsually smokey) that looked interesting. Overall though, not the best stay I've had. I won't be staying again.

truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"I am usually a big fan of Kimpton Hotels, but this place is awful !!! I would rate it poor from the moment we arrived to the moment we left. It is an old, dark and damp hotel that they slapped a coat of paint on to make it look more 'botique' . The carpets are dirty, and tattered; patrons are walking around the lobby in their barefeet. yuck!!! The bathrooms are tiny, and the floors look like they have a layer of flith on them. When we called down to the desk to ask for them to be cleaned, we were brushed off and told they were made to look that way. We woke up on the first morning to find multiple wads of gum on the lobby table. We told the front desk, called housekeeping, and then called the front desk again..finally after several hours someone came and cleaned the gum. The elevators are slow, and often only one is working at any given time. I did not find the staff to be friendly at all, except for one waiter @ breakfast. What a disappointment :(
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"So...the location to the Clark/Lake train stop is great...and that is the only thing that is great with the hotel. The wall are very thin...so much you can hear giggling and early morning housekeeping conversations in the hallway. There is no coffee maker in the room, however; free coffee is available in the lobby...becuase everyone wants to go to the lobby first thing in the morning??? Finally, the 'business center' is a pay for use set-up...no courtesty internet usage or printing. Lastly...they bathroom is micro-tiny and lacks in counterspace and comfort.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"We were at the Hotel Allegro for an Industry Analyst event. I could not have expected worse. At first glance, you figured it couldn't be too bad as a Kimpton. The unfortunate issue - service and the people were excellent. However, the rooms just sucked. Imagine your normal hotel room and 1/3 that size. Cramp in a king size bed and add a bathroom that's also 1/3 the size. The building has that old hotel smell where things are musky but covered up with some paint smell. The bathroom has showers with modern fixtures but remind you of that nyc studio you rented with 5 other people out of college. The paints peeling on the base boards, the carpet is new, but something is wrong. I would stay at the Marriott, Renaissance, Westin, or any where else.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"My Husband and I did not enjoy stay at Hotel Allegro! The room was so small. The bathroom was ridiculously stupid, everytime you use the sink you would splash water on yourself. Truly one person at time in the bathroom, it was like being in an airplane's bathroom. The walls are so thin, we heard the people across hall having sex. The some staff were really rude. I did not appreciate it when we had a sign on the door saying do not disturb the day of our check out. Check out time is 11am or 12 and we got a know on the door at 8AM with the sign stating ' do not disturb. ' The hotel did not have any microwaves in their rooms, no mini fridge, and no coffee maker either. NO DRAWERS to put your clothes in and the closet was very very very tiny. We were there for four days and three nights, so we had three suit cases full of clothes and no places to store them at. I also hated the fact that we had to pay almost fifty to park our car. My Husand and I will never stay at Hotel Allegro again!!!
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"I usually stay at the Hotel Monaco but stayed at the Allegro because most the Monaco was booked. While the Allegro is similar to the Monaco in it's decor (less traditional and more funky interior) it is not nearly as nice. The linens are not as high quality as the Monaco and the rooms are not decorated as nice. The rooms are also smaller. The main reason I would not recommend the hotel though, is the bathroom. It has an old tiled floor, with an old sink, and old toilet. It reminds me of something you would find in a men's locker room. Although the Allegro has installed a nice mirror, it does not make up for the limited counter space and dingy apperance. Also, the layout of the bathroom is terrible. The toilet is so close to the wall that the toilet paper sits in your lap as you sit on the toilet. Also, the room is not very clean as well. The floor in my room was dirty and I found crumbs in the drawers. I would recommend staying at the Monaco, Hard Rock, or Soffitel for a hotel that is a little less traditional but still nice.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"This place had character I'll give it that. But it wasn't really my style. Arrived late in the evening. The first room they gave me the TV didn't work. Maintenance took a look at it, and couldn't figure it out. Told me I'd have to wait until the morning for the electrician. He then passed some gas and left. Real professional. I phoned the front desk on account of the tv, and was able to get another room The second room was much like the first. Horrible striped wall paper, dingy, and old worn carpet. Bathroom was incredibly small. Hard to use the toliet without banging into the door, or the sink. Very cramped. The beds weren't very comfortable either. Room temp hard to regulate and the AC somewhat noisy. Location seem very convenient. I was there for a training session about 8 blocks away. But all of the theatres seemed to be near by, if thats what you were there for this place may be tolerable for a night or two. And don't make a long distance phone call from your room without a calling card. It was about $2/minute. I knew it would be expensive but wasn't expecting that type of rate.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"This is about the fourth time we stayed at the Allegro. The previous times, I have nothing but good to say about the Allegro. But my reaction has soured on this place. We have stayed here the past few years on the first weekend in December as a kick off to the holiday season and our shopping. From the very start, this year was a disappointment. I had checked the deals on a number of sites before calling the Allegro. I was quoted one price (higher than what was on line), when I mentioned this, I was told I could have the lower price. At check in, the desk was nice but not friendly. We discovered that our room was not as good as in the past (punishment for asking for a lower price?) The closet had no hangers, we had no place to put our suitcase. No one mentioned the wine reception in the evening. On the second day, we discovered that even our bath mat for the shower was missing. It took two phone calls and almost two hours to get a new one. I wrote the management following our stay. I have yet to receive a reply. Needless to say we will be looking elsewhere when we go into the city the next time. I would advise others to do the same.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"The room wasvery tiny and was very warm. They give you the illusion that you control the temperature but they do. The bathroom is small. The tub is plastic retro fit as stated in another review, and does crackle under your feet. I, personally, did find the water pressure to be fine and the bath ammenities to be of good quality. The public areas are nice and are good to hang out in. This is basically an old hotel that has been updated. The comment about the closet is true, it is actually indescriable. You can hear everything occuring in the other rooms. The location is convienent but so are many other hotels. If you do stay, fly into Midway, take the Orange Line, you cannot go wrong.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro, I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left. She seems to have a cough today. In the room on my right, someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit. I hear the water running and the toilet flushing. I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs. Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms. I've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst. The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains, the curtains with a large brown stain (I don't want to guess what it is), paint peeling, rips in the wallpaper. The decor is a bit garish, with Pepto-Bismol covered walls, green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet. The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable, but I'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others' toilets flushing all night. The location is good for downtown theaters or business. Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly. Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I've enjoyed quite a bit. Unfortunately this is not one of them, and even more unfortunate for me: I'm stuck here for two more nights. I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip, comfortable and attractive. This is not.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"A disappointment to say the least. I have heard rave after rave about Hotel Allegro and was super excited when our brother-in-law gave us an American Express gift card that we decided to use for a night out! I called Hotel Allegro and made the reservation for a Saturday night. The person who took the reservation was very sweet and assured me that there would be no problem using the gift card, since they do indeed take American Express. I couldn't wait to get there! We arrive at Hotel Allegro at about 3:00 on Saturday afternoon. Me, the tourist, I am already taking pics of the sign out front and trying to get a sneek peak of the ballroom set up for a wedding. We get in the line to check in. I give them the gift card and my check card. They tell me that neither one will work because they are charging the cards for not only the room rate, but for incidentals as well. We give them a credit card instead. While in line checking in, we hear complaint after complaint from other guests and I start to wonder what our experience is going to be like. The guy at the front desk is on the radio with the bell-man. Someone's luggage has been lost. He desk clerk snaps at the bell-man for the entire line to see. Not impressed. We get to our little shoebox of a room that I was so disappointed to see. The rooms on the website looked glorious! My bedroom at home is nicer than this tiny room. The sink is too small - water splashes everywhere even as evident by the water all over the floor when we got into our room. Yuck. We stay the night and go to check out in the morning. Again, I give them the American Express gift card. The clerk says 'their system usually doesn't take them'. I tell him that I called to confirm that their system would take it on Friday. He swipes the card and bam! it works! What do you know?? He was so rude. I will not stay at Hotel Allegro again, nor would I recommend it to anyone. Such a disappointment!
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"We stayed two nights. We were registered by a very unfriendly desk attendant. He was very cold. Our room was very, very small and the closet did not even hold the few clothes we packed for two days. The room was stylishly decorated but lacked the nice small touches such as an extra pillow in the closet. We were attracted to this hotel because a bar was on the ground level - however when we went to have a drink, the door to the bar was locked. We called to inquire why the sign said was open when it really wasn't and were told they were short staffed, 'sorry'. WHAT?? are you running here? You are a hotel in the country's third largest city and your amenities are open at whim? This was our first and last visit to a Kimpton hotel.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"I'm a frequent business traveler and often in Chicago on trips. At times, it's very difficult to even find a hotel in downtown Chicago, and this was one of those times. I recently had to pay almost $400 for one night at the Allegro. It was absolutely not worth it. The hotel was filled to capacity with conventioneers, so check-in and check-out were very slow. There were very few elevators, which were worked beyond capacity with all the guests. The morning I checked out, our elevator stopped at every single floor from the 16th floor down to the lobby, but the elevator was almost completely full when I got on at the 18th floor, so I can only imagine how long it must have taken other guests to get downstairs. The room was extremely small and cramped, even though it had obviously been renovated recently. The TV, bed, and decor were all new and were the high points of the hotel. Still, the rate was way overpriced for such a small room. The best thing about the Allegro was the room service, which was prompt. The food was good, and the prices were very reasonable for room service. From now on, if my regular hotels are booked, I'll just take a cab farther out from the city because it just isn't worth it.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"Check ins went smoothly. But be advised.... Walls are super thin, the building is old and the rooms are very very very small. The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out. For the price it wasn't bad. It was walking distance to most major attractions. Overall ... it's ok at best. Another plus is the CTA is close by.
"
truthful,allegro,negative,Web,"We recently stayed at the hotel allegro in chicago illinois, while the hotel was nice please take my advice and do not stay here. I payed cash for the room and handed over my credit card for incedentals ($50.00) the next day my debit card was charged $200 clearly this had to be a mistake...i called the hotel manager who was the rudest person i have ever spoken with about the charge and was told that it was my fault i paid cash and that i could give him my bank account, routing, SS # and authorization code and he could call my bank and take care of it. Clearly i am smart enough not to give this information to anyone yet alone someone who had already taken more then should have been charged. I then called corporate to complain and let them know about the situation the only thing corporate could tell me is that they had already credited my account and that they were sorry and it was clearly my mistake. I then questioned them about the manager asking for all my information if they had already credited my account and they told me they didnt have an answer for me. So for your bank accounts sake do not stay here they are many other options in chicago
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago while on a business trip. I have to say that I was very displeased with the service i received during my stay. Even though their website boasts that their staff will be at your beck and call, i found them to be very rude. The beds were extremely uncomfortable and the noise level very high. I was awakened by guests in the next room several times. Even though I complained to the front desk, they did not resolve the issue. I definitely would not recommend this hotel and I will be staying at a different hotel if I am in the area again.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently, and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience. I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegro's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services, so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night. Upon arriving, the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant. Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint, but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy. After check-in, which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing, we headed to our room trying to be optimistic. Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested, the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound, and we only had a stock of 2 towels, which were never replaced during our stay. We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel. It was a huge disappointment, for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl. I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel. There are much better choices in the Chicago area.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I recently visited Chicago. I stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago. First of all I did not enjoy the welcome as i checked in to the hotel. My hotel price was off the roof and i only used it to sleep and eat breakfast. The food served was not up to par I felt like it was a cheap 'free' lunch. My room was crowded and my waste baskets did not have bags in them. My toilet paper row was half way finished when I checked in. I felt that the house keepers gave us dirty looks as we went in and out of the room. I did not feel safe, I had to hide my valuables and I kept the 'BUSY' sign on the door so no one would enter and take stuff. The rooms did not appear as they do on their website, it is actually the opposite. Looked to me like a regular motel inn but I paid way more than I would have at an actual motel inn. I did not appreciate that none of the electrical outlets worked and my phone was dead for my whole duration of the trip. I would not recommend this Hotel to anyone.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter. I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels. I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation. Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way. I booked the hotel stay for over a week, which was very expensive, and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL, despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well! They did nothing to accommodate me, and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she 'didn't know the area' To tope it all off, the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it. Worst hotel experience of my life, I will never go back. - Sandy D.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"My wife and I recently stayed at the Allegro hotel in Chicago and were extremely disappointed. It claims to be a luxury hotel, but the air conditioning in our unit wasn't working and the ice maker in refridgerator was unbearably slow. We phoned in these issues to the front desk and the person on the other end assured us these problems would be taken care of. Noone ever showed up. Aside from that, there were so many kids running around we couldn't think straight. This is just my two cents, but I'd would tell anyone considering staying at the Allegro to pass and look at their other options.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I was very unsatisfied with my stay at the Allegro. The front desk clerk seemed very put out when we walked up to her window. After giving her our confirmation number she let us know that our rooms were not ready yet. This came as a surprise to me since we arrived late in the day and check in had already began. After waiting an hour to check in we were not able to get the room features that we had requested. We were informed that they were 'only requests' and not a guarantee. Room service was also very slow and appeared to be understaffed. When we finally got someone to answer the phone they were out of most everything we wanted. The food took an eternity to reach the room and the order wasn't exactly right either. This is not the kind of service I expected from an upscale hotel.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago this past summer. Needless to say we will not be returning! The Hotel is very overpriced for what you get. Upon arriving to the hotel the staff was very unfriendly and could not help with questions we had. The bed was very uncomfortable and the 'fully-stocked honor bar' was stocked with only a few choices. The shower did not even work!We booked the King Suite with Jacuzzi but ended up only getting a king room with no jacuzzi. I would not recommend this place!
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"Upon my arrival at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago I had to wait to be helped by a bellman for 10 minutes while I waited outside in the towncar. The bellman that ended up assisting me dropped two of my suitcases as he pushed his cart through the lobby. The front desk service rep was busy on the phone when I approched and raised a finger to me to hold on while she finished her call. Once I recieved my key and entered my room I realized that I had been checked into a dirty room. I called the front desk and asked for a new room and the same desk rep. that I had previously checked in with told me that there wern't anymore available rooms. She told me that I needed to come back down to the lobby. As I approched the desk I heard her yelling at a housekeeper. She then told me that it would be a 15 minute wait and my room would be ready. I didn't have the energy to complain at that point having traveled on a plane for the past 4 hours so I just sat in the lobby waiting for my room to be cleaned. While I was waiting I watched another person being checked in and they were not only given a room without a reservation but they were upgraded to a suite at no extra charge - why was I not given that suite after what I just went through? 35 minutes later the desk rep came over to me and let me know that my room was ready. I went back up to the same room that I had previously entered. It was clean but there was no toliet paper and no towels. I called back down to the desk rep and she said house keeping would be on thier way with the items. If my stay wasn't already horrible enough after I changed and went down to the 312 retaurant connected to the hotel I ended up having to wait 30 minutes after the reservation I had made to be seated. The meal was ok but nothing like I had expected it to be when I read about it online. I can honestly say I will never be returning to this hotel nor this restaurant.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere. It smells because pets are allowed. This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed. There was mold in our room and bathroom, pet hair everywhere! Kids love pools. How can they claim to be kid friendly without one? My kid was bored. The food was basically the same every day, no variation in the menu. Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their 'travel club' because our room didn't even remotely resemble the pictures. They did the old bait and switch. We reserved a 'family room'. When we opened the door of our room, we realized that it wasn't what the website pictured or had what the website described. We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers. Definitely do not recommend this hotel!!!
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"My wife and I were very much looking forward to our stay at the Hotel Allegro in Chicago. We had been looking forward to a romantic getaway. I have to say Hotel Allegro was a disappointment for both of us. This is a pet friendly hotel - we knew that going in. But we were shocked by the fact that we found pet hair around the room we were given. In the carpet and even an amount on the bed cover. Very shocking for the price we were paying. When we called the front desk it took over an hour for someone from housekeeping to stop by. Past this - the room itself - it has flair I guess, but I can't imagine it is the right flair for many. The colorings used a bright blue on the bed and a muted yellow, designy wallpaper. Neither myself or my wife found it relaxing at all. I can't imagine many would. It really was off-putting. Overall, the experience was a check minus in my book. Will not be looking to return any time soon.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"Since this was our first visit to the 'windy city,' we wanted to stay somewhere that was central and unique. We read many great reviews regarding the Kimpton brand so we gave it a go. The 'go' ended up being a 'no go.' We were sorely disappointed. When we arrived the ladies at the front desk were very nice. We have two kids with us, so we needed a crib for our 6 month baby. We were told 'no problem.' Unfortunately, it took them about 1 or 2 hours to get us the crib and we were in a lurch as to what to do next. Then, we noticed a bug (or bugs) near the fridge area. Yikes! We called downstairs to complain and to be switched to a different room (or floor!). Our request was met about 30 minutes later. By this time, we were so tired from the flight and the first impressions, we almost wanted to throw the towel in. Customer service was so lacking! We wanted to get settled and go grab a bit in the city, but had to wait around for our new room and the crib. This is not what we expected at all for this HIGH price! Will have to think hard before we book with a Kimpton hotel again.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I recently stayed at the Hotel Allegro Chicago with my wife. I was on business but I thought I'd take her so we could see the city as well. Chicago was great, The Allegro...not so much. I mean it looked nice, great lobby and all. The service wasn't so great though. The clerk was a younger girl who seemed a bit rude. Like we were bothering her and interrupting her day by wanting to book a weekend. The bell hop took our bags to our room, none to gently. My wife and I watched as he threw our luggage on the floor in our room. Which wasn't that bad till he actually asked for a tip! Our room was okay. The bed was sort of rough and made a odd plastic rubbing noise every time you moved. The next day my wife went out and returned to find our room wasn't cleaned. Our trip to the Chicago had it's nice moments, all outside the hotel. The Hotel Allegro seemed like they spent too much on the appearance and neglected to staff it better. I won't stay there again.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"Your website wowed me enough to book online although I had never used your hotel. I had high expectations when visiting your hotel with my family on our recent trip to Chicago and I was VERY disappointed. The first problem was that there was not enough staff at the desk. We had to wait a long time to get checked in. When we finally got to the room the beds were unmade and cleaning supplies were in the bathroom. The maid hadn't finished the room and she'd left her stuff behind! Of course we called the desk right away and got a new room but it was a huge hassle. The next problem was the dog of the person across the hall and down one. We knew this was a pet friendly hotel but we envisioned well controlled, non barking pets. This animal barked repeatedly when my kids were trying to go to sleep. I called the desk twice and eventually the barking stopped. I think the dog just gave up because it didn't sound like the desk staff knew what to do. The crowning disaster, at least for my kids and husband, was that the remote control for the tv was dead. We managed to get that taken care of but it was just the icing on the cake. Your hotel looks great but actually being there is not great. I cannot recommend it to anyone.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel. The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance. Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level, this was most disappointing. Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"While the hotel looked absolutely lovely from the outside, my experience went downhill once I walked in. The lighting is very poor, which creates such a dark and gloomy atmosphere. The mood was accompanied by less-than-friendly staff members who made our check-in seem like nothing more than a huge hassle. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a quiet night or a nice stay. I definitely would not stay here again.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"The Hotel Allegro located in the Chicago Loop, provided my wife and I with one of the worst hotel experiences in recent memory. We ordered the weekend Liquid Therapy package 48 hours prior as noted on their website, but to our surprise when we arrived, our names were nowhere to be found in their system! No room, no accommodations at the restaurant, nothing had been prepared for us and apparently another couple had already reserved the last available slot. A weekend away turned into the weekend from hell when we were asked to take a smaller room than I originally booked, and never did they offer us a replacement dining option! I have a receipt and credit card statement that shows our reservations being made on time. We will never be staying here again.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"My wife and I were guests at the Hotel Allego in Chicago for a long weekend getaway (September 2 - 5, 2011). We had checked out the hotel's website long before booking and were quite excited about our trip. Once we arrived, the hotel staff informed us that the room we requested was unavailable and brought us to a different room that smelled quite moldy. When I asked to be moved to another room (my wife has asthma) we were politely told that we were unable to be switched at that time. The room was not particularly well-cleaned: we found previous guests hair in the bathroom sink and on the floor, and a film of dust across the television set. We are not the type to complain, so we went out to explore the city and assumed that would be the worst of it. At nighttime when we tried to sleep, we discovered the bed sagged terribly in the middle and the walls were so thin, every nearby conversation could be heard perfectly. We were tossing and turning half the night. In the morning we hoped a quick workout might help energize us for the day, but we discovered that the wellness and fitness center described on the website was really not at all what we anticipated: a few treadmills and a dilapidated weight rack. The concierge was almost never around in the lobby (her sign always said 'Be right back!') and when we did ask her questions, she was actually somewhat cold and rude towards us. The second night was without incident, luckily, except for the terrible bed, but the third night we were woken up three times by hotel staff trying to enter the room to clean despite our 'Do Not Disturb' sign. I would not recommend this hotel.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"This hotel was not at all what I expected it would be. The website and it's pictures portray the hotel in a much better condition than it is actually in. The amenities were not what I was looking for, and the price of the hotel was not a good value for what was offered there. My AAA membership did not get me a very good discount like it does at most hotels. The staff was not very friendly or helpful when I had questions about the area, and they were not very prompt when responding to requests. I understand that there were a lot of guests staying there while I was there, but they need to have more staff on hand if they cannot provide their hotel guests with quality service. I don't think I will be staying at this hotel again anytime soon.
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I arrived at the hotel 15 minutes prior to check in time as they recommend. When I get there I noticed that there is a couple and two other people waiting in line to check in. Ten minutes later after standing there with my suitcase, the woman at the front desk informs us that their computers are down due to a recent update to the software. She told us to wait until the computers booted back up. I asked if I could drop my suitcase off at the room and she said no because they need to electronically activate the cards and with the computers down they couldn't activate the cards. Finally another 20 minutes later the computers were up and I finally got my room. Wheres the 'luxury' in waiting 35 minutes for a room? They also need to change the name of the hotel because their service did not leave me 'allegro.'
"
deceptive,allegro,negative,MTurk,"I have been stayed in Allegro for two days. There are not other big prolems but one thing I'm not satisfied with is the light. It is dark in the room. Also in the bathroom, the light is not good. I have to open curtains. I have complained about this to their reception. They said they will fix it, but I did not get any response. I am very disappointed and I will never come back again.
